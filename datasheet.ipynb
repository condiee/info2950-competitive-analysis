    "###  Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "Last summer and continuing remotely, I have been working at MassGeneral Hospital for Children as a digital marketing and web development intern. MGHfC struggles with brand recognition in competition with other childrens' hospitals and healthcare facilities, and as such the digital marketing department at MGHfC has been publishing more patient education pages on the website about conditions treated at the clinics of MGH's children's hospital to try and rank in Google and generate more site traffic and appointments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their recent generation, MGHfC's pages are often beat in Google rankings by those of the Mayo Clinic, the widely acclaimed healthcare company based in Minnesota. Whereas the Mayo Clinic ranks in Google for 2.5m keywords, MGHfC ranks for 90,813 (data from previous analysis on https://moz.com/). To study what site structure and SEO tactics aid the Mayo Clinic in ranking in Google so often and so highly for their education pages, in this project I will be analyzing the contents of their Symptoms and Causes pages of their listed diseases and conditions to try and detect patterns in their pages that may be boosting their page rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final dataset I will be working with is a self-contained conglommeration of data I scraped from the Mayo Clinic's site and data provided by an SEO analysis helper tool that I have access to due to my internship position, Screaming Frog SEO Spider (indeed, that is the name of the application).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "With the goals outlined above in mind, SEO Spider provides valuable information that I would not otherwise be able to gather–in this case, data about the kinds of links on the pages (ingoing, outgoing, unique...). However, due to the way the Mayo Clinic's symptoms and causes URLs are structured, I have to filter out the pages that I want from the data it provides, which also includes other pages listed under Diseases and Conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could have done the project with only the Spider data, but I wanted to get more practice at webscraping! I'm proud of the result, even if the merging of the datasets is a bit redundant. Full disclaimer, I had hoped to scrape more data by hand than I got done for this draft of the datasheet, and I hope to use BeautifulSoup and XML parsing to do more of that for the final version.\n",
    "\n",
    "I scraped sample data from the particular pages that I wanted and merged it with data from Spider for the same pages. The resulting number of pages is fewer than either original set, weeding out some pages that I did not want to include in the analysis. The final product should be the full population of Symptoms and Causes pages on the Mayo Clinic site.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "In terms of the SEO Spider data, I crawled https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions to a depth of 2 and downloaded a .csv file which I then cleaned in this notebook so that the dataframe only included the columns I wanted. I left behind address (the \"ugly\" (non-canonical) version of the final url), status code (can access myself, and should be 200, not interesting for data analysis), page title and headers, which are standard across Symptoms and Causes pages, % total (code to content ratio), and empty columns that I asked Spider not to gather data for or that Spider left blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "**Observations:** Each row contains information about the symptoms and treatment page for a disease or condition listed on the Mayo Clinic website. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes:** The page's url, its primary header (H1, also the name of the condition described), the word count of the page content, the size of the page in bytes, the meta description of the page (what shows up in the Google result), the inlinks (internal links pointing to a given URL from the same subdomain that is being crawled), unique inlinks (count several internal links from the same subdomain page as 1), outlinks (internal links to other URLs on the same subdomain), unique outlinks, external outlinks (links to another subdomain), and unique external outlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "People are tangentially involved–the data I will be analyzing looks at how webpages were designed by someone, whether that's web designers working there or working for a company that created their website template, and the structure of the content of those pages, which likely have many different authors. Data about the people themselves will not be involved; only data about their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "The license for SEO Spider is funded by the MGH Marketing Department. My internship is unpaid–I am not completing this work for compensation besides my standing in this course, and the idea of applying this project to the area of my internship was entirely my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "To my knowledge, no one working for the Mayo Clinic is aware of this project, and none of the data used is confidential, private, or upsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset has not yet been used for any tasks. It could potentially be used by other competitors of the Mayo Clinic or the Mayo Clinic itself to attempt to improve marketing strategies. This data should not be used to compromise the Mayo Clinic or any associated groups."
